### About the Experiment 

Non-enzymatic browning (NEB) is one of the most important chemical reactions responsible for quality and color changes during the processing or prolonged storage of citrus fruit products. The Maillard reaction is the major cause of NEB in heated fruit juices. This reaction is initiated by the condensation of the carbonyl group of reducing sugars with free Î±-amino groups of amino acids. NEB may lead to some quality losses by altering the final product an unfavorable appearance and even result in reduced food safety due to new formed compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Since NEB has a significant influence on the product quality and safety, monitoring the extent of such reaction can be a valuable tool for assessing the product quality and safety during processing and prolonged storage. Spectroscopy in the visible wavelength range is the best method for monitoring the absorbance coefficient of the product and to determine the extent of NEB reaction in terms of non-enzymatic browning index (NEBI).
