## 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Instrumentation & Practical skill, Data analysis

<br/>

The user will re-register the pre-learnt concept of browning reaction of foods by performing the experiment; they will enhance their practical skill by their working with the experimental setup. They will be able to come to a conclusion by analyzing the results of different sample. 
<br/>
<br/>

## 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level
<br/>
<b> Description </b>

Here we have identified four learning objectives. As the experiment gives the knowledge about the non-enzymatic browning in the juice samples and the process to determine it, therefore it includes remembering of the pre-learnt concepts and then understanding the new concepts. Further during the experiment, user will be able to analyze the sample using spectrophotometer and based on the observed absorbance data, users will be able to determine and achieve the outcome. <br>
<br/>
<b> Method</b>
<br/>To achieve attainment of all the objectives, the experiment is designed to determine the non-enzymatic browning in the juice samples, so that students may learn through performing.
